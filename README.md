# single-spa-portal-vue
Fork of [Single spa portal example](https://github.com/me-12/single-spa-portal-example)

The only project aim is to make Vue router works since there is no any example on the Internet, but later on we will be probably create whole VueJS feature set, define it and try to collaborate with single-spa team members if possible.
